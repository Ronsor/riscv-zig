# RV64IM emulator

This repository contains a library for emulating RISC-V 64 CPUs with the multiply extension.

*Caveat emptor:* The implementation of RISC-V contained herein has not been tested for compliance.
It may produce incorrect results, and it most certainly does not reject all invalid instructions.

## TODO

* Support RV32 too (should be easy)
* Implemented privileged instructions
* Better documentation
